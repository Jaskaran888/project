In this paragraph, there will be detailed discussion of the sending and recieving of data from through internet from person to another. if i send a message 
to my friend and it will be converted into the codes which could be numbers and went through a host. it is only possible if both hosts have an ip address.
it helps the sender to send data and to request a server to find the ip address of the other user. than the package will be converted into codes and become encoded which
would be into bytes. and than that data gets decoded before it goes to the reciver. in this way, this whole process works.
